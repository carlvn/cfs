This repository was inspired by a reddit threat discussing how long humanity would need to recreate a smartphone from scratch if all technology was magically removed. Thinking about this I wondered if a copy of wikipedia would be helpful. I soon discovered, that wikipedia's information isn't very hands on and not ordered in a very useful way (because sometimes you don't even know what you don't know). 
So this repository is meant as a sort of real life tech tree and open source
