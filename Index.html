This repository was inspired by a reddit threat discussing how long humanity would need to recreate a smartphone from scratch if all technology was magically removed. Thinking about this I wondered if a copy of wikipedia would be helpful. I soon discovered, that wikipedia's information isn't very hands on and not ordered in a very useful way (because sometimes you don't even know what you don't know). 
So this repository is meant as a sort of real life tech tree and open source 

Beyond the initial thought experiment this compendium is meant to serve as a open source, more or less light weight, offline source of practical information for preppers, .... and everyone who is interested in future proofing our civilization or having an insurance with information on their machine or in printed form.
